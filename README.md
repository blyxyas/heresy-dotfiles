# Heresy Neovim

Also called, my dotfiles.
This is a **work-in-progress** project to translate all keybindings from Visual Studio Code (a filthy, electron-based program) to a sexy, CLI program known as neovim. Yes, the best part about VIM are the VIM Motions, you'll get blazingly fast with those. This is an alternative to those who have already mastered the art of moving efficiently through files with other editors, and want to move to the popular terminal editor.

With these dotfiles, the editor will start already in insert mode, and will abide by [these new rules](https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-linux.pdf). What used to be normal mode, now is but a husk of its former glory, because now **all keys in normal mode enter insert mode**. It's like a parody.
